## Architectural Concerns

- **AI model management:** Different models or versions may affect accuracy and latency, so version control and configuration are key.  
- **Integration stability:** External systems like LMS or calendars may go down, requiring retry and recovery mechanisms.  
- **Role-based access:** Students, lecturers, and administrators have different permissions, so RBAC must be enforced.  
- **Context handling:** The assistant must blend live and stored data for accurate, contextual answers.  
- **Data privacy:** Conversations and user data should be securely stored and anonymized when possible.  
- **Cross-platform support:** The interface should work smoothly on web, mobile, and voice devices.  
- **Monitoring and observability:** Logging latency, accuracy, and usage metrics is essential for maintainers.
