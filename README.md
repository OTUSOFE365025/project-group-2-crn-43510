## Business Drivers

The university currently uses separate systems for LMS, email, and registration, which makes it hard for students and faculty to get quick, unified answers.  
AIDAP provides a single conversational interface that connects all institutional data sources, reducing administrative load and improving student engagement.

**Key objectives**
- Streamline access to academic information  
- Reduce help-desk and admin workload  
- Improve communication efficiency  
- Increase student satisfaction and system adoption
